## You want to rest the hypothesis that the range size of carnivores is influenced by their body size (larger carnivores roam further).  You want to be sure that if you do see a relationship that is is not just due to shared evolutionary history.  That is you want to do a phylogenetic regression.

# 1) Load the data as follows

```{r}
library(rethinking)
library(ape)
library(ade4)
```

```{r}
data("carni70")
```

```{r}
tre <- read.tree(text=carni70$tre)
d <- carni70$tab
```

# 2) Note that the species name given in "rownames(d)" and in "tre$tip.label" do not match.  Fix that (e.g. using str_replace() )

# 3) Should either range or size be transformed?

# 4) Does size predict range?  Evaluate this question without and with accounting for phylogenetic relationships.

# 5) Discuss your findings.
